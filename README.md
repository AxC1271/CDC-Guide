# Clock Domain Crossing Techniques

## Abstract
This GitHub repository explores the concept of clock domain crossing using different techniques, from multi-flop synchronizers to 
asychronous FIFOs and handshaking. Each subdirectory will come with a schematic of the synchronizer, block diagrams Verilog code, physical
layout on Magic VLSI, and SPICE directives that can capture parasitics and be simulated on ngspice. This repo not only aims
to explain the process as a way to teach myself but also provide educational content to a reader interested in knowing about clock domain crossing.

## A Critical Problem in Digital Circuit Design

## Different Types of Synchronizers

### Multi-Flop Synchronizers

### Toggle Synchronizers

### Multiplexer Synchronizers (Mux Recirculation)

### Asynchronous FIFOs

### Handshaking

## Why do I need to know this?
